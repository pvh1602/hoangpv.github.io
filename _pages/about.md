Hi! I'm Hoang. I'm currently a Research Assistant at VinUniversity working with [Prof. Khoa D Doan](https://khoadoan.me/). Prior to that, I was an AI resident at FPT Software AI Center where I was advised by [Prof. Long Tran-Thanh](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/long_tran-thanh/), [Prof. Dung Le Duy](https://andrew-dungle.github.io/), and [Dr. Anh Ta-The](https://the-anhta.github.io/). Previously, I was a member of [Data Science Lab](http://ds.soict.hust.edu.vn/) in Hanoi University of Science and Technology where I earned my Engineering Degree in Computer Science. 

**Research:** My research interests include but are not limited to:
- *Trustworthy AI*: I focus on investigating the robustness of models against backdoor attacks. Besides, I am interested in watermarking models or generated data.
- *Efficient Deep Learning*: I am interested in improving model training/deployment through efficient transfer learning, reducing model size, and utilizing synthetic datasets.
<!-- My current works focus on Sparse Neural Network, Continual Learning, and Meta Learning with the ultimate goal that creating AI model having the learning abilities like human (rapid and continuous learning tasks without catastrophic forgetting). In particular, I am investigating brain-inspired Continual Learning model which different network's components take into account different tasks. -->
