Hi! I'm Hoang. I'm currently an AI resident at FPT Software AI Center where I'm advised by Professor [Long Tran-Thanh](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/long_tran-thanh/), Dr. Dung Le Duy, and Dr. Anh Ta-The. Previously, I was a research assistant at [Data Science Lab](http://ds.soict.hust.edu.vn/) in Hanoi University of Science and Technology where I earned my Engineering Degree in Computer Science. 

**Research:** My current works focus on Sparse Neural Network, Continual Learning, and Meta Learning with the ultimate goal that creating AI model having the learning abilities like human (rapid and continuous learning tasks without catastrophic forgetting). In particular, I am investigating brain-inspired Continual Learning model which different network's components take into account different tasks.
